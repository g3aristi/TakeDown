ext2_ln: This program takes three command line arguments. The first is the name of an ext2 formatted virtual disk. 
The other two are absolute paths on your ext2 formatted disk. The program should work like ln, creating a link 
from the first specified file to the second specified path. If the first location does not exist, if the second 
location already exists, or if the first location refers to a directory, then your program should return the 
appropriate error.
